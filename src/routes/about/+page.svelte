        <p>Hello there fellow internet traveler! You have stumbled across an information page that will now give you a glimmer of information about me.</p>
        <p>I am a professional software engineer that has been creating Bukkit/Spigot/Paper plugins for quite a while now. 
            My career speciality lies in Software Applications, Infrastructure, and Design for real-time constrained systems.
            However, I have experience outside of that area with ventures in Web Development (ok I know this is not the best example but I swear), Machine Learning, and Game Development.</p>
        <p>In terms of languages, I'm pretty fluent in English occassionally. Oh, you meant programming languages? My main ones are C++, Java, and Python. But I can survive in a lot of the popular ones like
            Javascript, Rust, Kotlin, and whatever else is trending right now.</p>
