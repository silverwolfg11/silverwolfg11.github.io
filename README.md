# silverwolfg11.github.io

The source code behind the website. The website utilizes the [Svelte framework](https://svelte.dev/) and is a fork of the [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte) template.

## Developing

Svelte uses NPM for workflow and dependency management, so make sure you got NPM installed!

Install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of this website:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
